###Hello World

##About me:

I'm an architect under construction. I've lived a life full of love, care and support. 
My parents are simply peerless! My dad is my hero and my mom is my guidebook and my siblings are annoying! 
I love climbing mountains, canyoning, paragliding and rafting! I also love challenges 
and nothing can stop me. I've learned French, Spanish, a bit of Javascript and now python! Finally, I can't wait to 
use python in Architecture and become a sucessful, well-known architect.
